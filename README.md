# JSONForms - More Forms. Less Code
### Complex Forms in the blink of an eye

JSONForms eliminates the tedious task of writing fully-featured forms by hand by leveraging the capabilities of JSON, JSON Schema and Javascript.

# WebComponent Package
This package showcases how JSON Forms can be used as a webcomponent. It doesn't contain any renderers by itself but only a wrapper for react-based renderer sets. This wrapper allows you to reuse the renderers in a webcomponent based application.

You can combine the WebComponent package with any react-based renderer set you want, for example the [Material Renderers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jsonforms/material-renderers) or the [Vanilla Renderers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jsonforms/vanilla-renderers). You will also need the [JSONForms React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jsonforms/react) package.

The WebComponent Package was actively maintained with JSON Forms up until [version `2.3.2`](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/tree/0cf18d3df877c5240188b0ae4e0d18e3638fc026).

## Professional support
[EclipseSource](https://eclipsesource.com/) also offers [professional support for JSON Forms](https://jsonforms.io/support).
